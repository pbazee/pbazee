👋 Hi there! I'm Pbazee, an IT professional with a knack for both front-end and back-end development. Currently immersing myself in the world of backend development, specializing in Python, JavaScript, and PHP.

💻 In my journey, I've enjoyed crafting intuitive user interfaces and robust server-side solutions. Passionate about creating seamless experiences that bridge the gap between user expectations and technical capabilities.

🔍 Currently, I'm delving deep into backend technologies like Django, Express.js, and Laravel, exploring their intricacies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. I also love working with NoSQL databases like MongoDB for flexible data storage solutions.

☁️ Experienced in deploying applications on server environments like Apache and harnessing the power of Google Cloud Platform for scalable and reliable backend infrastructure.
